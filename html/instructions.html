            <h1>Object of the game:</h1>
            <p>
                A player must connect 4 of their game pieces horizontal, vertical, diagonal-up, or diagonal-down in
                order to win a game.
            </p>
            <h2>How to play:</h2>
            <p>
                Connect 4 is a 2 player game. To play the game, select the "New Game" button to take you to the game
                page. In the game page select the "Start Game" button to begin. Each player, starting with player 1,
                will take turns dropping their game piece into any column of the game board. Each piece will fill an
                empty spot on the board and stack on top of previously dropped pieces. The player who is first to
                connect 4 of their pieces, again this can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, wins this game!
            </p>
            <h2>Scoring:</h2>
            <p>
                Both players begin the game with score : 0 - 0. When a player wins, the score will be updated on the
                scoreboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can play many rounds by selecting
                <strong>Start Game</strong> after a win and the score will continue to update. If you would like to
                start a new game entirely, you can select <strong>Reset Score</strong> button on the side of the
                scoreboard.
