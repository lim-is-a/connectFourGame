            <h1>Object of the game:</h1>
            <p>A player must connect 4 of their game pieces horizontal, vertical, diagonal-up, or diagonal-down in order
                to
                win
                a game.
            </p>
            <h2>How to play:</h2>
            <p>Select Start game button to begin playing.
                Each player will take turns dropping their game piece into a column of the game board. Each piece will
                fill
                an empty spot on the board and stack on top of previously dropped pieces. The player who is first to
                connect 4 of their pieces, wins!
            </p>
            <p>When a player wins, the score will be updated on the scoreboard. You can play many rounds by selecting
                <strong>Start Game</strong> after a win and the score will continue to update. If you would like to
                start a new game entirely, you can select <strong>Reset Score</strong> button on the side of the
                scoreboard.</p>
